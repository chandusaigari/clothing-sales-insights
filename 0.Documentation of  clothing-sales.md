This project showcases an end-to-end data analytics workflow using a synthetic dataset of 2.3 years of clothing sales. The goal was to simulate real-world retail data, perform data cleaning and preprocessing with Python, and apply exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance.

The insights were then transformed into interactive dashboards in Power BI, providing clear business solutions to key questions such as:
